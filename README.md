##    HOTEL CANCELLATION 

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
City Hotels and Resorts are experiencing high booking cancellations rates which in turn leads to fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use.
Hence lowering the cancellation is our priimary goal to increase their efficiency in generating revenues and offering business ideas to approach the problems.

### ASSUMPTIONS

3. The solutions and suggestions provided by us to the hotel will be agreed with utmost sincerity and without any negative remarks.
4. The solution provided to hotels is not used by them currently.
5. The biggest factor affecting the revenue of hotels is booking cancellation.
6. Client make bookings and cancellation on the same year.
   
### RESEARCH QUESTIONS
1.What are the factors or variables that affect hotel booking cancellations?  <br>
2.How can we decrease the booking cancellations?  <br>
3.How will the hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?  <br>

### HYPOTHESIS

2.When there is no clarity of rooms available or rooms are in waiting list option they tend to cancel it more frequently.  <br>
3.Cancellations are seen higher if they are booking reservations via offline travel agents.  <br>

### ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS

1.From visualizing the bar chart , we found that even though 37% seems to be less but it is more than half of the not cancelled rooms ,thus it can cause a huge loss of revenue to the hotel management.<br>

2.From the bar graph of Resort hotels and City hotels , it is observed that both cancellation and bookings are  more observed in city hotels. <br>
3.Less boookings in Resort hotels may indicate its expensiveness. <br>
4.More cancellation in City hotels may indicate its expensiveness. <br>

1.It is observed that JANUARY has highest cancellation while AUGUST has least cancellation.<br>
2. It shows that as price gets higher the more will be the cancellation rate. So, accomodation cost is solely responsible for cancellation.<br>

1.From the above graph it is seen that majority of customers book reservation through  Online Travel Agent <br>
2.So the assumption that Cancellation is seen more from Offline Travel Agent is found to be false.<br>
3. 1-Online TA      47% <br>
   2-Groups           28% <br>
   3-Offline TA/TO    19% <br>
   4-Direct            4% <br>
   5-Corporate        2.2% <br>
   6-Complementary    0.2% <br>
   7-Aviation         0.1% <br>

1.As ADR is increased the Cancelled bookings are also increasing thereby indicating higher the price higher the cancellation. <br>
​
2. The reservations gets cancelled when the price is higher than when it is not cancelled.Therefore , higher price leads to more cancellation. <br>

### SUGGESTIONS <br>
1. We observed that higher price leads to more cancellation. So , it could be controlled if hotel management takes initiatives like offering incentives  in the form of lower pricing of  hotels in certain places, providing the customers  with discount or coupon codes and providing better customer engagement. <br>
2. As discovered, the ratio between cancelled bookings and not cancelled bookings is observed more in RESORT HOTELS  than CITY HOTELS. So, they must reduce their prices in weekends to increase more bookings. <br>
3. JANUARY is experiencing the highest cancellation , inorder to resolve this, hotels should- <br>
   1.Offer attractive packages that add value for guests while maintaining high room rates. <br>
   2.Continuously monitor and adjust room rates to maximize revenue.   Increase prices as demand increases but ensure rates remain competitive. <br> 
   3.Focus marketing efforts on segments that are more likely to book during high ADR periods, such as business travelers, event attendees, or tourists. <br>
   4.Run special campaigns to attract more guests and capitalize on the high demand. <br>
   5.Allocate rooms strategically, prioritizing premium rooms that can command higher rates. <br>
   6.Monitor competitor pricing and occupancy strategies to ensure your rates remain competitive and attractive. <br>
4.AUGUST observinhg highest reservations , this can be made consistent by- <br>
   1.Focussing on customer loyalty programs to encourage repeated bookings. <br>
   2.Carefully manage overbooking to optimize occupancy without risking excessive cancellations or relocations. <br>
   3. Reinforce your market positioning as a premium or value-driven property. <br>
   4.Increase prices as demand increases but ensure rates remain competitive. <br>
   
5. So PORTUGAL must address the issues to reduce cancellations:-  <br>
    1.Tailor marketing efforts to address concerns or preferences of customers from these countries. <br>
    2.Offer promotions or incentives to reduce cancellations.  <br>
    3.Adjust booking and cancellation policies for guests from these countries to mitigate potential revenue loss.  <br>
    4.Enhance communication and provide more flexible booking options to encourage retention and reduce cancellations.  <br>
